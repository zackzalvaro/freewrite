Woop has done it!

But yeah literally the 12-1pm start to day 1 after a long break such an important buffer.
I cannot imagine the sort of thing I missed about being so attuned-in the longly feeling, bored, and unfocused too much.
I think this is time I make stuff as I can be more focused now than ever in a month.
Thatâ€™s like a skill. I am glad I manufacture it.
