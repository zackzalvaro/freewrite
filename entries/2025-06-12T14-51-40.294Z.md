Focused on lots of things I felt I became productive. I was. I just think that problems and sometimes coherent things are different things. I did some project though that was differently focused. I shouldve point toward a clear way to learn math?? Not sure

But I changed the proper things toward using urge to search or maybe plan on something too much. I also try to focus on  evening breath. And food awareness has been okay since I didnt fully remember the last time…. Man I’m feeling out of place to remember and write.
And I can say the urge for porn addiction has been promising for all its worth. I think J can say little about them being worse than yesterday.
