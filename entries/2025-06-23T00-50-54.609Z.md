Many things at once indeed. I cannot really say the specifics but yesterday was a full on episode. I can say I am: masks and facades - more than I can convince myself.

Yesterday started with much more slower. I can see philosophy is helping me. Just that the days move towards something that is always a merit of destruction. Sometimes I feel kinda numb towards that. I wonder is there a new way to see this?

I know because of how the nature it is built. I am connected in how I treated philosophy but at the same time worldy class of philosophize— I remember monents where I hated that. But the more I thought about it is beneficial - but not all context need that to happen to be understood as a pivotal thing.

I need to suspect that math would give me an answer - yet we know that measurements and the idea of enfolding is above me than I can chew for a particular subject - I am way above league. I can say more on them on geochemi though, need for the books that Bohm would’ve read.
